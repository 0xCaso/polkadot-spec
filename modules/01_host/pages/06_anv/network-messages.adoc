=== Network Messages

The availability and validity process requires certain network messages to be exchanged between validators and collators.

==== Notification Messges

The notification messages are exchanged between validators, including messages
sent by collators to validators. The protocol messages are exchanged based on a
streaming notification substream (xref:04_networking/fundamentals.adoc#sect-connection-establishment[Sect.]). The
messages are SCALE encoded (xref:02_encoding.adoc#sect-scale-codec[Sect.]).

[#net-msg-validator-protocol-message]
