[#sect-collations]
=== Collations

Collations are proposed candidates xref:06_anv/definitions.adoc#defn-candidate[Def.] to the Polkadot relay
chain validators. The Polkodat network protocol is agnostic on what candidate
productionis mechanism each parachain uses and does not specify or mandate any
of such production methods (e.g. BABE-GRANDPA, Aura, etc). Furthermore, the
relay chain validator host implementation itself does not directly interpret or
process teh internal transactions of the candidate, but rather rely on the
parachain Runtime to validate the candidate (xref:06_anv/candidate-validation.adoc#sect-candidate-validation[Sect.]).
Collators, which are parachain nodes which produce candidate proposals and send
them to the relay chain validator, must prepare pieces of data
(xref:06_anv/collations.adoc#defn-collation[Def.]) in order to correctly comply with the requirements of the
parachain protocol.

==== Collation
****
A collation is a datastructure which contains the proposed parachain candidate,
including an optional validation parachain Runtime update and upward messages.
The collation datastructure, C, is a datastructure of the following format:

[stem]
++++
C = (M,H,R,h,P,p,w)\
M = (u_n,…u_m)\
H = (z_n,…z_m)
++++

where

* stem:[M] is an array of upward messages (xref:06_anv/definitions.adoc#defn-upward-message[Def.]), stem:[u],
interpreted by the relay chain itself.
* stem:[H] is an array of outbound horizontal messages
(xref:06_anv/definitions.adoc#defn-outbound-hrmp-message[Def.]), stem:[z], interpreted by other parachains.
* stem:[R] is an _Option_ type (xref:02_encoding.adoc#defn-option-type[Def.]) which can contain a
parachain Runtime update. The new Runtime code is an array of bytes.
* stem:[h] is the head data (xref:06_anv/definitions.adoc#defn-head-data[Def.]) produced as a result of
execution of the parachain specific logic.
* stem:[P] is the PoV block (xref:06_anv/definitions.adoc#defn-para-block[Def.]).
* stem:[p] is an unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the number of processed
downward messages (xref:06_anv/definitions.adoc#defn-downward-message[Def.]).
* stem:[w] is an unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the mark up to which all
inbound HRMP messages have been processed by the parachain.
