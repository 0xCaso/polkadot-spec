The genesis state is a set of key-value pairs representing the intial state of
the Polkadot state storage. It can be retrieved from
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/node/service/res[the Polkadot
repository]. While each of those key-value pairs offers important identifyable
information to the Runtime, to the Polkadot Host they are a transparent set of
arbitrary chain- and network-dependent keys and values. The only exception to
this are the `:code` (xref:03_transition/runtime_interaction.adoc#sect-loading-runtime-code[Sect.]) and `:heappages`
(xref:03_transition/runtime_interaction.adoc#sect-memory-management[Sect.]) keys, which are used by the Polkadot Host to
initialize the WASM environment and its Runtime. The other keys and values are
unspecified and solely depend on the chain and respectively its corresponding
Runtime. On initialization the data should be inserted into the state storage
with the Host API (xref:storage.adoc#sect-storage-set[Sect.]).

As such, Polkadot does not defined a formal genesis block. Nonetheless for the
compatibility reasons in several algorithms, the Polkadot Host defines the
_genesis header_ (xref:03_genesis.adoc#defn-genesis-header[Def.]). By the abuse of terminology,
"genesis block" refers to the hypothetical parent of block number _1_ which
holds genisis header as its header.

[#defn-genesis-header]
The Polkadot genesis
header is a data structure conforming to block header format (xref:03_transition/state_replication.adoc#defn-block-header[Def.]). It contains the following
values:

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Block header field |Genesis Header Value

|`parent_hash`
|_0_

|`number`
|_0_

|`state_root`
|Merkle hash of the state storage trie (xref:02_state/state_storage_trie.adoc#defn-merkle-value[Def.]) after inserting the genesis state in it.

|`extrinsics_root`
|_0_

|`digest`
|_0_
|===
