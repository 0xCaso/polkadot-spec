[#sect-runtime-blockbuilder-module]
==== BlockBuilder Module (Version 4)

All calls in this module require `Core_intialize_block`
(xref:modules/core.adoc#sect-rte-core-initialize-block[Sect.]) to be called beforehand.

[#sect-rte-apply-extrinsic]
===== `BlockBuilder_apply_extrinsic`

Apply the extrinsic outside of the block execution function. This does
not attempt to validate anything regarding the block, but it builds a
list of transaction hashes.

Arguments::
* A byte array of varying size containing the opaque extrinsic.

Return::
* Returns the varying datatype _ApplyExtrinsicResult_ as defined in xref:modules/blockbuilder.adoc#defn-rte-apply-extrinsic-result[Def.].
This structure lets the block builder know whether an extrinsic should
be included into the block or rejected.

.ApplyExtrinsicResult
[#defn-rte-apply-extrinsic-result]
====
*ApplyExtrinsicResult* is a varying data type as defined in xref:02_encoding.adoc#defn-result-type[Def.].
This structure can contain multiple nested structures, indicating either module
dispatch outcomes or transaction invalidity errors.

.Possible values of varying data type _ApplyExtrinsicResult_.
[cols="<1,<6,<3",options="header"]
|===
|*Id* |*Description* |*Type*

|0 |Outcome of dispatching the extrinsic.
|_DispatchOutcome_ (xref:modules/blockbuilder.adoc#defn-rte-dispatch-outcome[Def.])

|1 |Possible errors while checking the validity of a transaction.
|_TransactionValidityError_ (xref:modules/blockbuilder.adoc#defn-rte-transaction-validity-error[Def.])
|===
====

NOTE: As long as a _DispatchOutcome_ (xref:modules/blockbuilder.adoc#defn-rte-dispatch-outcome[Def.]) is returned,
the extrinsic is always included in the block, even if the outcome is a dispatch
error. Dispatch errors do not invalidate the block and all state changes are
persisted.

[#defn-rte-custom-module-error]
====
*CustomModuleError* is a tuple appended after a possible error in as defined in xref:modules/blockbuilder.adoc#defn-rte-dispatch-error[Def.].

.Possible values of varying data type _CustomModuleError_.
[cols="<2,<4,<4",options="header",]

|Error |Module specific error value. |Unsigned 8-bit integer

|Message |Optional error message. |Varying data type _Option_ (xref:02_encoding.adoc#defn-option-type[Def.]).
The optional value is a SCALE encoded byte array containing a valid UTF-8 sequence.
|===
====

NOTE: Whenever _TransactionValidityError_ (xref:modules/blockbuilder.adoc#defn-rte-transaction-validity-error[Def.])
is returned, the contained error type will indicate whether an extrinsic should
be outright rejected or requested for a later block. This behaviour is clarified
further in xref:modules/blockbuilder.adoc#defn-rte-invalid-transaction[Def.] and respectively xref:modules/blockbuilder.adoc#defn-rte-unknown-transaction[Def.].

.InvalidTransaction
[#defn-rte-invalid-transaction]
====
*InvalidTransaction* is a varying data type as defined in xref:02_encoding.adoc#defn-varrying-data-type[Def.]

[#defn-rt-blockbuilder-finalize-block]
===== `BlockBuilder_finalize_block`

Finalize the block - it is up to the caller to ensure that all header
fields are valid except for the state root. State changes resulting from
calling this function are usually meant to persist upon successful
execution of the function and appending of the block to the chain.

Arguments::
* None.

Return::
* The header of the new block as defined in xref:03_transition/state_replication.adoc#defn-block-header[Def.].

[#defn-rt-builder-inherent-extrinsics]
===== `BlockBuilder_inherent_extrinisics`:

Generates the inherent extrinsics, which are explained in more detail in
xref:03_transition/extrinsics.adoc#sect-inherents[Sect.]. This function takes a SCALE-encoded hash table as defined in
xref:02_encoding.adoc#defn-scale-list[Def.] and returns an array of extrinsics. The Polkadot Host must
submit each of those to the `BlockBuilder_apply_extrinsic`, described in
xref:modules/blockbuilder.adoc#sect-rte-apply-extrinsic[Sect.]. This procedure is outlined in xref:05_consensus/block_production.adoc#algo-build-block[Algo.].

Arguments::
* A Inherents-Data structure as defined in xref:03_transition/extrinsics.adoc#defn-inherent-data[Def.].

Return::
* A byte array of varying size containing extrinisics. Each extrinsic is a byte
array of varying size.

===== `BlockBuilder_check_inherents`

Checks whether the provided inherent is valid. This function can be used
by the Polkadot Host when deemed appropriate, e.g. during the
block-building process.

Arguments::
* A block represented as a tuple consisting of a block header as described in
xref:03_transition/state_replication.adoc#defn-block-header[Def.] and the block body as described in xref:03_transition/state_replication.adoc#defn-block-body[Def.].
* A Inherents-Data structure as defined in xref:03_transition/extrinsics.adoc#defn-inherent-data[Def.].

Return::
* A data structure of the following format:
+
[latexmath]
++++
(o, f_e, e)
++++
+
where

** latexmath:[o] is a boolean indicating whether the check was successful.
** latexmath:[f_e] is a boolean indicating whether a fatal error was encountered.
** latexmath:[e] is a Inherents-Data structure as defined in xref:03_transition/extrinsics.adoc#defn-inherent-data[Def.]
containing any errors created by this Runtime function.

===== `BlockBuilder_random_seed`

Generates a random seed.

Arguments::
* None

Return::
* A 32-byte array containing the random seed.
