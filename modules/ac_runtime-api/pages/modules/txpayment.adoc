==== TransactionPaymentApi Module (Version 1)

All calls in this module require `Core_initialize_block` (xref:modules/core.adoc#sect-rte-core-initialize-block[Sect.]) to be called beforehand.

===== `TransactionPaymentApi_query_info`

Returns information of a given extrinsic. This function is not aware of
the internals of an extrinsic, but only interprets the extrinsic as some
encoded value and accounts for its weight and length, the Runtimeâ€™s
extrinsic base weight and the current fee multiplier.

This function can be used by the Polkadot Host implementation when it
seems appropriate, such as for the JSON-RPC API as described in xref:intro.adoc#sect-json-rpc-api[Sect.].

Arguments::
* A byte array of varying sizes containing the extrinsic.
* The length of the extrinsic. [To do: why is this needed?]

Return::
* A data structure of the following format:
+
[latexmath]
++++
(w, c, f)
++++
where
** latexmath:[w] is the weight of the extrinsic.
** latexmath:[c] is the "class" of the extrinsic, where class is a  varying data (xref:02_encoding.adoc#defn-varrying-data-type[Def.]) type defined as:
+
[latexmath]
++++
c = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
       0 \quad \textrm{Normal extrinsic}\\
       1 \quad \textrm{Operational extrinsic}\\
       2 \quad \textrm{Mandatory extrinsic, which is always included}
     \end{array}\right.
++++
** latexmath:[f] is the inclusion fee of the extrinsic. This does not
include a tip or anything else that depends on the signature.

===== `TransactionPaymentApi_query_fee_details`

Query the detailed fee of a given extrinsic. This function can be used
by the Polkadot Host implementation when it seems appropriate, such as
for the JSON-RPC API as described in xref:intro.adoc#sect-json-rpc-api[Sect.].

Arguments::
* A byte array of varying sizes containing the extrinsic.
* The length of the extrinsic.

Return::
* A data structure of the following format:
+
[latexmath]
++++
(f, t)
++++
+
where

** latexmath:[f] is a SCALE encoded as defined in xref:02_encoding.adoc#defn-option-type[Def.] containing the following data structure:
+
[latexmath]
++++
 f = (f_b, f_l, f_a)
++++
+
where
*** latexmath:[f_b] is the minimum required fee for an extrinsic.
*** latexmath:[f_l] is the length fee, the amount paid for the encoded length (in bytes) of the extrinsic.
*** latexmath:[f_a] is the "`adjusted weight fee`", which is a multiplication of the fee multiplier and the weight fee. The fee multiplier varies depending on the usage of the network.
** latexmath:[t] is the tip for the block author.
